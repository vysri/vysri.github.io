Hello! I am a PhD student at the University of Washington advised by [Prof. Shwetak Patel](https://www.cs.washington.edu/people/faculty/shwetak-patel/) as a part of the [Ubicomp Lab](https://ubicomplab.cs.washington.edu/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of human-computer interaction, systems, and intelligence, with primary application areas being **speech/conversational AI** and **AI for health**.

I previously obtained my bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the University of Michigan ECE, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Robert Dick](https://robertdick.org/) on embedded systems and resource-constrained ML.
